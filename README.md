# Personal-Expense-tracker
I've created a personal finance tracker using the MERN stack, designed to help you manage your finances with ease. The application allows you to add both income and expenses, and it automatically calculates the percentage increase in your income and expenses over time.

One of the key features is the visual representation of your financial data through simple line graphs, making it easy to see trends and changes at a glance. You can quickly identify your maximum and minimum salary and expenses, giving you a clear picture of your financial highs and lows.

Additionally, the tracker maintains a detailed transaction history, allowing you to review and analyze your financial activities over time. This helps in understanding your spending habits and making informed financial decisions.
